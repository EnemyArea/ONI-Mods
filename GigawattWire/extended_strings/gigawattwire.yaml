      JACKETEDWIRE:
        NAME: '<link="JACKETEDWIRE">Insulated Wire</link>'
        EFFECT: |-
          Connects buildings to <link="POWER">Power</link> sources.
          
          Can be run through wall and floor tile.
        DESC: 'By coating the wires in plastic they suddenly became much safer.'

        NAME: '<link="JACKETEDWIREBRIDGE">Insulated Wire Bridge</link>'
        EFFECT: |-
          Carries even more <link="POWER">Wattage</link> than a <link="WIREREFINEDBRIDGE">Conductive Wire Bridge</link> without overloading.
          
          Runs one wire section over another without joining them.
          
          Can be run through wall and floor tile.
